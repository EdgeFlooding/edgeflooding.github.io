## EdgeFlooding - Exploiting Edge computing for Real-Time Monitoring and Detection of Flash Floods

The EdgeFlooding project funded by the NGIatlantic initiative under the 3rd open call for experiments is a bilateral project between the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Pisa and the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. The projects aims at assessing the feasibility of adopting a Cloud/Edge computing approach to implement a flood monitoring system based on image analysis and social media crawling.
