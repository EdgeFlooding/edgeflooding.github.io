## EdgeFlooding - Exploiting Edge computing for Real-Time Monitoring and Detection of Flash Floods


The EdgeFlooding project funded by the NGIatlantic initiative under the 3rd open call for experiments is a bilateral project between the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Pisa and the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. 

The goal of the EdgeFlooding project is to assess the feasibility of adopting a Cloud/Edge computing approach for the implementation of the flood monitoring system developed at UMBC. The University of Pisa and the University of Maryland aims at assessing the feasibility of implementing the image and data analysis of the system in a distributed manner, where image and data analysis is performed at the Edge level directly in proximity of the monitoring station, while social media analysis is performed at the Cloud level. Results from the analysis performed at the Edge layer are transmitted to the Cloud in order to obtain a global view (e.g. for regional monitoring) and to implement training and optimization functions to increase the accuracy of the models deployed at the Edge layer. In details, by extending the current implementation of the flood monitoring system and by running a set of real experiments, the team aims at verifying the feasibility of implementing the image and analysis algorithms directly on the Edge nodes, and at measuring metrics such as latency and bandwidth for data transmission between Edge and Cloud to assess their compatibility with a real implementation.
